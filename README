CurrencyRates
=============

Very simple class for getting up to date currency rates in an array. You pass a base currency which the rates will be converted into. Connects to the european bank
to get a daily breakdown of the rates.

This is deliberated lightweight to allow you to build on top of this.

Example
=======

<pre>
parser = CurrencyRates::Parser.new('GBP')
puts parser.engage.inspect
</pre>

Valid values for the initialize call are:

<pre>
